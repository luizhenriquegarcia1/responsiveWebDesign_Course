                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>
                    Alan Mathison Turing (23 June 1912 -- 7 June 1954). Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing 
                     a formalisation of concepts of algoirthm and computation with the <strong>Turing Machine</strong>,
                      which can be considered a model of general-purpose computer. He is considered to be the father of theoretical computer science 
                      and artificial intelligence.</p>

                    <h2>School</h2>
                    <p>
                    Born in London, Turing was raised in southern England. 
                    He graduated in maths from <strong>King's college, Canbridge</strong>
                    , and in 1938, earned a maths PhD from Princeton University. During the Second World War, 
                    Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at <em>Bletchley Park</em>, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. He led <strong>Hut 8</strong>, the section responsible for German naval cryptanalyst. He devised techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the prewar Polish bomba method, an electromechanical machine that could find settiings for the <strong>Enigma Machine</strong>. Turing
                    played a crucial role in cracking intercepted messages that enabled the 
                    Allies to defeat the <em>Axis powers</em> in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic.

                    <h2>University and Work</h2>
                    <p>
                        After graduating from Sherborne, Turing applied for several Cambridge colleges scholarships, including
                        Trinity and King's, eventually earning an $80 per annum scholarship (equivalent to about $4,300 as of 2023) to study
                        at thee latter. There, Turing studied the undergraduate course in Schedule B (That is, a three-year Parts I and II, off the Mathematical Tripos, with extra courses at end of the third year, as Part III only emerged as a separate degree in 1934)
                        from February 1931 to November 1934 at <strong>King's College, Cambridge</strong>, where he was awarded first-class honours in mathematics.

                    <h2>Bombe</h2>
                    <p>
                        Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park, Turing had specified an electromechanical machine called the <strong>bombe</strong>, 
                        which could break Enigma more effectively than Polish bomba kryptologiczna, from which its name was derived. 
                        The bombe, with an enhacement suggested by mathematician Gordon  Welchman, became one of the primary tools. and the major automated one, 
                        used to attack Enigma-enciphered messages.

                    <h2>Hut 8 and the naval Enigma</h2>
                    <p>
                        Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of cracking German 
                        naval use of Enigma "because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself. 
                        In December 1939, Turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system, which was more complex than the indicator systems 
                        used by the other services.</p>

                    <h2>Early Computers and the Turing test</h2>
                    <p>
                        Between 1945 and 1947, Turing lived in Hampton, London, while he worked
                        on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computer Engine) at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL).
                        He presented a paper on 19 February 1946, which was the first detailed design of a stored-program computer.
                        Von Neumann's incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing's paper, but it was much less detailed and,
                        according to John R. Wormersley, Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics 
                        Division, it "contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing's own." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">More Information here...</a>
