# Resposive Web Design by freeCodeCamp

In this repository, all projects completed in the Responsive Web Design course provided by the freeCodeCamp platform are included. The course covered topics related to HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) in its HTML5 version and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) in its CSS3 version. Concepts such as indentation and clean code were addressed through the platform's evaluation tool. The semantic organization of HTML content was managed, including the correct use of links, declaration of classes and IDs, implementation of ordered and unordered lists, tables, and forms. Internal website management was also covered, including character encoding, integration with CSS files, and links.

Furthermore, concepts of content styling were introduced, applying the cascade model, respecting the hierarchy of elements, classes, and IDs, as well as the correct declaration of selectors and media queries. Therefore, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the contributors of the freeCodeCamp platform for the opportunity to enhance my skills. Stay tuned to the repository for updates!
